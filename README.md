Certainly! Here's a comprehensive set of SQL queries covering each concept related to the `Employees` table. I'll explain each concept with a query for you to make clear revision notes.

### 1. **Creating the Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    firstName VARCHAR(50),
    lastName VARCHAR(50),
    hireDate DATE,
    hourlyPaid DECIMAL(5, 2),
    contactDetails VARCHAR(100),
    mailID VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### 2. **Basic SQL Queries**
#### a. **SELECT Statement**
To select all records from the table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### b. **INSERT INTO**
To insert a new employee:
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (employeeID, firstName, lastName, hireDate, hourlyPaid, contactDetails, mailID)
VALUES (101, 'John', 'Doe', '2021-01-15', 25.50, '123-456-7890', 'john.doe@example.com');
```

#### c. **UPDATE Statement**
To update an employee's hourly paid:
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET hourlyPaid = 30.00
WHERE employeeID = 101;
```

#### d. **DELETE Statement**
To delete an employee from the table:
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE employeeID = 101;
```

---

### 3. **Filtering and Conditional Queries**
#### a. **WHERE Clause**
To select employees hired after 2020:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE hireDate > '2020-01-01';
```

#### b. **LIKE Operator**
To select employees whose first name starts with 'J':
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE firstName LIKE 'J%';
```

#### c. **BETWEEN Operator**

WHERE hireDate BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2023-01-01';
```

#### d. **IN Operator**
To find employees with specific IDs:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE employeeID IN (101, 102, 103);
```

---

### 4. **Sorting and Limiting Results**
#### a. **ORDER BY Clause**
To get employees sorted by hire date:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY hireDate DESC;
```

#### b. **LIMIT Clause**
To get only the first 5 employees:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY employeeID
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### 5. **Aggregating Data**
#### a. **COUNT Function**
To count the number of employees:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalEmployees FROM Employees;
```

#### b. **SUM Function**
To get the total hourly paid to employees:

```

---

### 6. **Joins and Relationships (Hypothetical Tables)**
If you have another table `Departments`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    departmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    departmentName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

To join `Employees` and `Departments` on `employeeID` and `departmentID` (assuming a foreign key exists):
```sql
SELECT E.employeeID, E.firstName, D.departmentName
FROM Employees E
INNER JOIN Departments D ON E.departmentID = D.departmentID;
```

---

### 7. **Subqueries**
#### a. **Simple Subquery**
To find employees who earn more than the average hourly rate:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE hourlyPaid > (SELECT AVG(hourlyPaid) FROM Employees);
```

#### b. **Correlated Subquery**
To find employees hired later than at least one other employee:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees E1
WHERE hireDate > (SELECT MIN(hireDate) FROM Employees E2 WHERE E2.employeeID != E1.employeeID);
```

---

### 8. **Group By and Having**
#### a. **GROUP BY Clause**
To group employees by their hourly pay:
```sql
SELECT hourlyPaid, COUNT(*) AS numEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY hourlyPaid;
```

#### b. **HAVING Clause**
To find hourly rates with more than 3 employees:
```sql
SELECT hourlyPaid, COUNT(*) AS numEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY hourlyPaid
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

---

### 9. **Indexing**

```

---

### 10. **Transactions**
#### a. **Starting a Transaction**
To begin a transaction, insert a new record, and then commit it:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (employeeID, firstName, lastName, hireDate, hourlyPaid, contactDetails, mailID)
VALUES (102, 'Jane', 'Smith', '2022-03-10', 28.00, '555-1234', 'jane.smith@example.com');

COMMIT;
```

#### b. **ROLLBACK**
To revert changes in a transaction:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (employeeID, firstName, lastName, hireDate, hourlyPaid, contactDetails, mailID)
VALUES (103, 'Robert', 'Johnson', '2023-04-12', 30.00, '987-6543', 'robert.johnson@example.com');

ROLLBACK;
```

---

### 11. **Views**
To create a view showing only employee names and hire dates:
```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeSummary AS
SELECT firstName, lastName, hireDate
FROM Employees;
```

---

### 12. **ALTER TABLE (Modifications)**
#### a. **Adding a New Column**
To add a column for departmentID:
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD departmentID INT;
```

#### b. **Dropping a Column**
To drop the `contactDetails` column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN contactDetails;
```

---

### 13. **Constraints**
#### a. **Adding a NOT NULL Constraint**
To ensure `mailID` cannot be NULL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY mailID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;
```

#### b. **Adding a Unique Constraint**
To ensure that `mailID` is unique:
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_mailID UNIQUE (mailID);
```

---

### 14. **Normalization**
#### a. **First Normal Form (1NF)**
Ensure that each column in `Employees` contains atomic values (no repeating groups):
```sql
-- This is ensured in the `Employees` table by defining columns with single values.
```

#### b. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
Ensure that all non-key columns are fully dependent on the primary key:
```sql
-- The `Employees` table satisfies 2NF as all columns depend on `employeeID`.
```

#### c. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
Ensure that all non-key columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key:
```sql
-- The `Employees` table satisfies 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.
```

---

### 15. **ACID Properties**
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing (`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`).
- **Consistency**: The database transitions from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not affect each other.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanent.

---

These queries should help with your revision by covering essential SQL concepts using practical examples with the `Employees` table!

Certainly! Here’s a clear breakdown of some often-confusing SQL concepts, with key differences and examples. This should make your understanding more solid:

---

### 1. **DROP vs DELETE vs TRUNCATE**
These commands are used to remove data, but they operate at different levels.

#### a. **DROP**
- **Purpose**: Permanently removes a table or database from the system.
- **Action**: The table and its data are completely removed.
- **Rollback**: Cannot be rolled back (unless within a transaction, depending on the DBMS).
  
**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP TABLE Employees;  -- Removes the entire Employees table and all its data.
```

#### b. **DELETE**
- **Purpose**: Deletes specific rows from a table.
- **Action**: Removes data row by row based on a condition.
- **Rollback**: Can be rolled back (if inside a transaction).
- **Affects**: Only data, not the table structure.
  
**Syntax**:
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE employeeID = 101;  -- Deletes only employee with ID 101.
```

#### c. **TRUNCATE**
- **Purpose**: Removes all rows from a table, but keeps the table structure.
- **Action**: Fast because it does not generate individual row delete logs.
- **Rollback**: Cannot be rolled back (depending on DBMS).
  
**Syntax**:
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;  -- Deletes all rows from Employees but keeps the table.
```

**Key Differences**:
- **DROP** removes the table itself.
- **DELETE** removes specific rows, and you can use a `WHERE` clause.
- **TRUNCATE** clears all rows but retains the table structure.

---

### 2. **UPDATE vs ALTER**
These commands are used to modify the data or structure of a table.

#### a. **UPDATE**
- **Purpose**: Updates existing data in a table.
- **Action**: Modifies the data in specific rows based on a condition.
- **Affects**: Data within the table.

**Syntax**:
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET hourlyPaid = 28.00
WHERE employeeID = 101;  -- Changes the hourly rate of employee with ID 101.
```

#### b. **ALTER**
- **Purpose**: Modifies the structure of a table (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying columns).
- **Action**: Alters the table’s schema.
- **Affects**: Table structure.

**Syntax**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD departmentID INT;  -- Adds a new column departmentID to the Employees table.
```

**Key Differences**:
- **UPDATE** modifies the **data** inside the table.
- **ALTER** changes the **structure** of the table (e.g., adding or removing columns).

---

### 3. **PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE KEY**
Both ensure uniqueness of values, but they have some differences.

#### a. **PRIMARY KEY**
- **Purpose**: Uniquely identifies each row in the table.
- **Action**: Ensures no two rows have the same primary key value.
- **Null Values**: Does not allow `NULL` values.
- **Limit**: A table can have only one primary key.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- employeeID is the primary key
    firstName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

#### b. **UNIQUE KEY**
- **Purpose**: Ensures all values in a column (or a set of columns) are unique.
- **Action**: Similar to `PRIMARY KEY` but allows `NULL` values.
- **Null Values**: Can allow one `NULL` value.
- **Limit**: A table can have multiple unique keys.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employeeID INT,
    mailID VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE  -- mailID must be unique for all employees.
);
```

**Key Differences**:
- **PRIMARY KEY** cannot be `NULL`, while **UNIQUE KEY** can allow one `NULL`.
- A table can have **only one PRIMARY KEY** but multiple **UNIQUE KEYS**.

---

### 4. **WHERE vs HAVING**
Both are used to filter data, but in different contexts.

#### a. **WHERE**
- **Purpose**: Filters rows before aggregation (or before any other operation).
- **Use**: Used in regular `SELECT` queries.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE hourlyPaid > 20.00;  -- Filters employees with hourly rate greater than 20 before any aggregation.
```

#### b. **HAVING**
- **Purpose**: Filters rows **after** aggregation.
- **Use**: Used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, etc.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT hourlyPaid, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY hourlyPaid
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;  -- Filters groups where more than 2 employees have the same hourly rate.
```

**Key Differences**:
- **WHERE** filters rows **before aggregation**.
- **HAVING** filters groups **after aggregation**.

---

### 5. **INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN vs RIGHT JOIN**
These are used to combine data from two or more tables.

#### a. **INNER JOIN**
- **Purpose**: Returns only rows that have matching values in both tables.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT E.firstName, D.departmentName
FROM Employees E
INNER JOIN Departments D ON E.departmentID = D.departmentID;  -- Returns only employees with matching department.
```

#### b. **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
- **Purpose**: Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If no match, `NULL` values are returned for the right table.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT E.firstName, D.departmentName
FROM Employees E
LEFT JOIN Departments D ON E.departmentID = D.departmentID;  -- Returns all employees, even if they have no department.
```

#### c. **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
- **Purpose**: Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If no match, `NULL` values are returned for the left table.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT E.firstName, D.departmentName
FROM Employees E
RIGHT JOIN Departments D ON E.departmentID = D.departmentID;  -- Returns all departments, even if no employees are assigned.
```

**Key Differences**:
- **INNER JOIN** returns only matching rows from both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** returns all rows from the left table and matches from the right.
- **RIGHT JOIN** returns all rows from the right table and matches from the left.

---

### 6. **UNION vs UNION ALL**
Both combine results from two `SELECT` queries, but they differ in how they handle duplicates.

#### a. **UNION**
- **Purpose**: Combines the results of two `SELECT` queries and removes duplicates.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT firstName FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT firstName FROM Managers;  -- Combines employees' and managers' first names, removes duplicates.
```

#### b. **UNION ALL**
- **Purpose**: Combines the results of two `SELECT` queries but **includes** duplicates.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT firstName FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT firstName FROM Managers;  -- Combines employees' and managers' first names, includes duplicates.
```

**Key Differences**:
- **UNION** removes duplicates.
- **UNION ALL** includes all records, even duplicates.

---

### 7. **VIEW vs INDEX**
Both improve query performance or manage data presentation, but they serve different purposes.

#### a. **VIEW**
- **Purpose**: A virtual table based on a `SELECT` query. It does not store data but retrieves it dynamically from the underlying tables.
  
**Example**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeSummary AS
SELECT firstName, lastName, hireDate FROM Employees;  -- Creates a view of selected columns.
```

#### b. **INDEX**
- **Purpose**: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It affects performance, not the data itself.
  
**Example**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastName ON Employees(lastName);  -- Creates an index on the lastName column for faster searches.
```

**Key Differences**:
- **VIEW** is a virtual table that simplifies complex queries.
- **INDEX** speeds up retrieval by organizing the data for faster search.

---

### 8. **DISTINCT vs GROUP BY**
Both are used to deal with duplicates, but they work differently.

#### a. **DISTINCT**
- **Purpose**: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT hourlyPaid FROM Employees;  -- Returns unique hourly rates from the Employees table.
```

#### b. **GROUP BY**
- **Purpose**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, often used with aggregate functions.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT hourlyPaid, COUNT(*) FROM Employees
GROUP BY hourlyPaid;  -- Groups employees by hourly rate and counts them.
```

**Key Differences**:
- **DISTINCT** removes duplicates from the result set.
- **GROUP BY** groups rows based on column values and allows for aggregation.

---

By understanding these differences with practical examples, you'll have a clear grasp of how and when to use each SQL command.
